run the code: Open a terminal in VS Code and type:
go run .\main.go
or
go run main.go    -- from the directory of main.go file 



cmd 
mkdir create new folder


 go install

go run --work main.go 

//If you are interested to know the location where go run compiles the file to, please run go run with the --work argument.


go build     
go build .
go build package-name     
go build -o binary-file-name



echo "" > file
new-item file-name.*
echo 'package data_structure' > arrays_slices.go













In Goâ€™s philosophy, it is better to avoid unnecessary branches and indentation of code. 
It is also considered better to return as early as possible.
