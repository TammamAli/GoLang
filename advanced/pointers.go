		. What is a pointer: A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable.
		. Declaring pointers: *T is the type of the pointer variable which points to a value of type T.
		. Zero value of a pointer The zero value of a pointer is nil.
		. Creating pointers using the new function
			Go also provides a handy function new to create pointers.
			The new function takes a type as an argument and returns a pointer to a newly
			allocated zero value of the type passed as argument
		. Dereferencing a pointer
		    It means accessing the value of the variable to which the pointer points. *a is the syntax to deference a.

		. Returning pointer from a function
			It is perfectly legal for a function to return a pointer of a local variable.
			The Go compiler is intelligent enough and it will allocate this variable on the heap.

		Do not pass a pointer to an array as an argument to a function. Use slice instead.
		Letâ€™s assume that we want to make some modifications to an array inside the function and the changes made to
		that array inside the function should be visible to the caller. One way of doing this is to pass a pointer
		to an array as an argument to the function. Although this way of passing a pointer to an array as an argument
		to a function and making modification to it works, it is not the idiomatic way of achieving this in Go. We have slices for this.

		Go does not support pointer arithmetic
		Go does not support pointer arithmetic which is present in other languages like C and C++.
